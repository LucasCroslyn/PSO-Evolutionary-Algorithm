# PSO-Evolutionary-Algorithm

This project was doing a simple Particle Swarm Optimization on some mathematical functions. Both single objective and multi-objective swarms were done. 

- The main file that shows the algorithms running is in the [main.ipynb]() Jupyter Notebook.
- The [SingleFunctions.py] file contains the functions for the single objective Partticle Swarm Optimization.
- The [MultiFunctions.py] file contains the functions for the multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization. 
- The images used for a writeup are displayed below.
